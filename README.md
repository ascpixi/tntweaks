### 🛠 Code
When contributing code, please keep performance and stability in mind. When creating a brand new feature, please make sure the module for the feature implements the `TNTweaksModule` interface. Refer to the [Google Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html).

If possible, avoid third-party libraries and NMS. If packet modification or optimization is necessary, NMS is allowed.
### 🌎 Translations
When making translations, please make sure that the name of the translation file corresponds to a valid [Minecraft locale code](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Language#Available_languages). The translations should not be machine-translated. Changing the `meta` section is allowed with proper reasoning.
